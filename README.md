When I was younger, reading was hard for me.
Some words stayed in my mind, but many others just disappeared. I felt like I wasn’t improving at all.

Now, I wanted to change that.

That is why I created READLY.
It doesn’t only let you read — it shows you your progress:
✨ Words you collect
✨ Sessions you finish
✨ Streaks that keep you motivated

But it’s more than numbers. It helps you understand the text better, ask questions, and really learn.

I made this for learners like me, who want to feel their growth step by step.

Would a tool like this have helped you when you were learning something new?
